                In just six months, more than 150,000 Americans have lost 
                their lives to COVID-19, with more than 4 million infected 
                by the virus that causes it. Cases continue to rise at an 
                alarming rate across much of the United States. If the nation 
                does not change its course – and soon – deaths in the U.S. 
                could well be in the multiples of hundreds of thousands. <br><br>
                The AAMC offers a road map to reset the nation’s response 
                to the pandemic based on our understanding and expertise as 
                doctors, scientists, and medical educators, as well as the 
                work we have done to help our members respond on the front lines 
                of patient care, testing, and medical research for effective 
                treatments and vaccines. <br><br>
                The road map identifies a set of nine evidence-based, commonsense 
                actions the AAMC believes is essential to act on immediately, and 
                two longer-term, larger-scale changes to improve the overall health 
                of our nation.

                The "diversity of response" by US states hampered the country's 
                ability to contain the spread of the coronavirus, Dr. Anthony 
                Fauci said at a congressional hearing on Friday, as the number 
                of cases in the US topped 4.5 million. <br><br>
                When asked why Europe appears to have been more effective at 
                controlling the spread of the virus, the nation's top infectious 
                disease expert said that it might have helped that about 95% of 
                Europe had shut down much earlier. <br><br>
                "When you actually look at what we did -- even though we shut down, 
                even though it created a great deal of difficulty -- we really 
                functionally shut down only about 50% in the sense of the totality 
                of the country," Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy 
                and Infectious Disease, said in response to a question from 
                Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina. <br><br>
                Some states also followed reopening guidelines more closely than others, 
                Fauci added, saying, "There are some states that did it very well and some 
                states that did not." <br>
                "I think there was such a diversity of response in this country from 
                different states that we really did not have a unified bringing everything 
                down," he added later, in response to a similar question from 
                Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland.

            <b>Source:</b> BBC News<br>

                Mr Cain, 74, was hospitalised after being diagnosed with 
                the disease earlier this month. <br>
                "Herman Cain - our boss, our friend, like a father to so 
                many of us - has passed away," a message posted on his 
                official website said. <br>
                Mr Cain, who in 2006 survived late-stage colon cancer, is 
                one of the best-known US victims of Covid-19. <br>
                His social media accounts had been providing regular updates 
                on his condition. On 7 July, a post from his Twitter account 
                said "doctors are trying to make sure his oxygen levels are right". <br>
                "This is a tough virus," it said. "Please continue praying."
                Mr Cain appeared without a mask at a rally held by 
                President Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on 20 June. <br>
                He was admitted to hospital with coronavirus on 1 July, though 
                it is unclear when or where he caught the infection. <br>
                The president paid tribute to Mr Cain on Thursday at the White House, 
                saying: "He was a very special person... and unfortunately he passed 
                away from a thing called the China virus."

        <img src = "./images/news4.jpg">
        <p>
            <b>Source:</b> CISLAC Nigeria <br>

                How Nigeria could avoid waste and corruption when spending billions 
                in IMF emergency assistance during COVID-19 <br>
                Amidst a catastrophic collapse of oil prices and a health care system 
                unable to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, Nigeria recently requested 
                US$3.4 billion in emergency assistance from the International Monetary 
                Fund (IMF). This massive loan, which was approved in April, adds to billions 
                of dollars in emergency assistance and should avert catastrophe for Africa's 
                largest economy and population of over 200 million.  <br>
                COVID-19 exposes cracks in an already broken health system <br><br>
                The coronavirus or COVID-19 pandemic highlights Nigeria's economic imbalances 
                and collapse of public services, which many Nigerians would argue had already 
                failed long ago.
                Budgetary appropriations for health have not improved much since 2016. At that 
                time, health was only 0.5 per cent of Nigeria's gross domestic budget or 5 per cent 
                of the national budget. <br>
                Unfortunately, without sufficient resources, the Nigerian health care system often 
                relies on ‘self-funding' through petty corruption and illegal fees. Patients pay these 
                costs of corruption.
                Given these limited funds, it's unsurprising that Africa's three most populous nations 
                – Nigeria, Ethiopia and Egypt – only have 1,920 intensive care beds between them for a 
                population of more than 400 million people. <br>
                While Europeans and Americans build emergency hospitals to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
                most Nigerians do not have access to even basic health care facilities.
                Government response falls short <br><br>
                As COVID-19 spread, Nigerian government officials seemed unprepared to tackle existing weaknesses 
                in the health system. For example, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, 
                was surprised and claimed he was unaware of the bad state of the nation's health sector until 
                he became chairman of the Presidential COVID-19 task force. <br>
                Many citizens took this as another sign that Nigerian leaders are out of touch and helplessly 
                unaware or disinterested in the collapse of public services, which often serve the poor and 
                most vulnerable people, who cannot afford private hospitals or medical care.
